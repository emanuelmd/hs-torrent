## HTorrent

An implementation of the Bit Torrent protocol in Haskell, mainly
done for fun and ~profit~.

Reading material:
- [BitTorrent Protocol Specification](http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0003.html)
- [Wiki Theory BitTorrent](https://wiki.theory.org/index.php/BitTorrentSpecification)

Currently, there's only some basic data types which are decoded
from bencoded strings.
